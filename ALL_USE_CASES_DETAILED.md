# BANKING & FINANCE

## DEPARTMENT 1: HUMAN RESOURCES

### USE CASE 1: AI-Powered Resume Screening & Candidate Matching

**Business Challenge:**
HR teams in banking institutions receive 500-1000 applications per role, spending an average of 23 hours per hire on manual resume screening. Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) rely on keyword-only matching, which results in:
- 40% of qualified candidates being overlooked
- Unconscious bias in manual screening processes
- Extended time-to-hire averaging 45+ days
- Loss of top talent to competitors who move faster
- High recruiter burnout from repetitive tasks
- $125K+ cost per unfilled critical role

The financial services industry faces unique challenges with specialized roles requiring specific certifications (CFA, CPA, Series 7, etc.) and regulatory knowledge that keyword matching often misses.

3. **Job Matching Algorithm**: Scores candidates based on true qualification fit using ML models
4. **Bias Detection**: Identifies and eliminates unconscious bias factors (age, gender, ethnicity indicators)
5. **Automated Ranking**: Provides qualification-based prioritization with confidence scores
6. **ATS Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing systems (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.)

**Technical Implementation:**
- NLP models trained on 10M+ financial services resumes
- Continuous learning from hiring outcomes
- Explainable AI showing why candidates ranked as they did
- Customizable scoring weights by role and department
- Multi-language support for global hiring

**Process Flow:**
1. **Resume Upload** → Candidates submit resumes through career portal, email, or ATS
2. **AI Analysis & Parsing** → NLP extracts all relevant information (education, experience, skills, certifications)
3. **Skill Extraction** → Identifies technical skills, soft skills, domain expertise, and certifications
4. **Job Matching Algorithm** → Scores candidates against job requirements using ML models
